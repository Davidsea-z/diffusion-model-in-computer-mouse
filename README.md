## Introduction
This project explores the application of diffusion models in computer mouse design generation. Using advanced generative AI techniques, we aim to create innovative and ergonomic computer mouse designs. The model generates various mouse designs based on different parameters and constraints.

Here's an example of a generated mouse design:

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;">
  <img src="generated_images/generated_0.png" alt="Generated Mouse 0" width="30%" style="margin: 5px;">
  <img src="generated_images/generated_1.png" alt="Generated Mouse 1" width="30%" style="margin: 5px;">
  <img src="generated_images/generated_2.png" alt="Generated Mouse 2" width="30%" style="margin: 5px;">
  <img src="generated_images/generated_3.png" alt="Generated Mouse 3" width="30%" style="margin: 5px;">
  <img src="generated_images/generated_4.png" alt="Generated Mouse 4" width="30%" style="margin: 5px;">
  <img src="generated_images/generated_5.png" alt="Generated Mouse 5" width="30%" style="margin: 5px;">
</div>
